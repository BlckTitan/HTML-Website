      Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average
      computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always
      questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo
      finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a
      legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. As a
      rebel against the machines, Neo must confront the agents: super-powerful
      computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human
      rebellion.â€”redcommander27
