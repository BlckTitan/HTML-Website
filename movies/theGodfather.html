        <strong>Storyline:</strong>
        The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family
        in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's
        youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding.
        Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business.
        Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but
        is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous
        rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito
        refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values
        and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most
        reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families
        which could tear the Corleone family apart. â€”srijanarora-152-448595
